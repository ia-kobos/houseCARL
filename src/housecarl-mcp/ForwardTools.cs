         "record VERBATIM, so SOURCE's version (not the winner) becomes the patch's content. ONE surface: what to " +
         "copy (formids=) x WHOSE version (source=) x WHERE it lands (the LANE) x how it reads back (TRANSPORT).\n\n" +
         "WHAT IT IS FOR: RE-ASSERT an earlier mod's version over a later override (a late total-overhaul " +
         "re-architected a record an earlier list patch had balanced — forward the earlier plugin's version back on " +
         "top), or REVERT a record to vanilla (name a master — Skyrim.esm/Update.esm/… — as source). This copies the " +
         "record WHOLE: it does NOT edit fields (that's housecarl_apply) and needs no field pre-flight, because a " +
         "complete source record is legal by construction.\n\n" +
         "formids= is set-valued — one or more 'XXXXXX:Plugin.esp', ALL copied from the SAME source; call again with " +
         "into= to forward from a different source into the same patch. It also accepts [\"@<absolute path>\"].\n\n" +
         "source= is any plugin that DEFINES or overrides each record — ACTIVE, or a file that is only ON DISK (a " +
         "DISABLED mod, an unticked plugin, a folder MO2 never registered; pass its full path if several folders " +
         "provide that filename). Re-asserting a disabled old patch's version is a first-class use of this tool, not " +
         "an edge case. Forwarding does NOT add source as a master: the patch overrides the record's ORIGIN FormKey " +
         "with the copied body, so the header carries the origin master + whatever the body references (exactly " +

         "LANE — where the write lands. Default: a NEW patch named patch= (auto-suffixed if taken). into='<an " +
         "existing patch's filename>' EXTENDS that patch — and if it ALREADY carries a forwarded FormKey, its " +
         "existing override is REPLACED by source's body (xEdit's copy-as-override overwrite, flagged per record). " +
         "in_place='<plugin filename>' forwards INTO an existing plugin's OWN file (incl. one houseCARL didn't " +

         "so you build on the forwarded body directly.\n\n" +
         "ALL-OR-NOTHING (Q3): the whole call is refused with a named reason and NOTHING is written if source is " +
