         "A FormID is 'XXXXXX:Plugin.esp' — 6 hex digits, a colon, the defining master's filename. Every edit " +
         "resolves the record's load-order WINNER and overrides it into the patch; all edits land in ONE reviewable " +
         ".esp, whose master header spans every plugin the edits reference (cross-master merge, derived not declared).\n\n" +

         "field's real type — a number, an enum name ('OneHanded'), or a FormID for a reference.\n" +
         "op is " + WriteVerbs.AllRecital + ". " +
         "InsertAtIndex inserts a NEW element AT key= and shifts the rest right (key = the list's length appends); use it to grow a POSITION-CONTIGUOUS run in place, e.g. adding an arm to an existing CTDA OR-group, where Add would land the row at the end as a separate AND-group. On a [Flags] enum (SPEL " +

         "everything outside the bundle are untouched BY CONSTRUCTION — a bundle only names what it copies. Which " +
         "paths form an appearance set or a balance frame is knowledge a skill carries, not a verb this tool owns. " +

         "accumulate across calls and sessions. PRECEDENCE with into= (pinned): a FormKey the patch ALREADY CARRIES " +
         "is edited AS-IS in the patch; only a FormKey it does NOT yet carry copies the load-order winner in first. " +
