        // spells the lane. (2) It creates one, but names it off something other than the "Patch" default — a
        // caller-supplied identifier, or a stem its own call site fixes. (3) The spelling names a DIFFERENT artifact
        // on that operation, because it declares more than one output name and §5.3 routes patch= to the artifact.

        // "Omit into= to create it fresh", justified as "merely less helpful, never wrong" — and the removal lane,
