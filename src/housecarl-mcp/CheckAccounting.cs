/// ONE ACCOUNTING for the integrity sweep's response, consumed by BOTH transports (#337's one-source-per-sentence,
/// applied to the numbers underneath the prose rather than only to the prose).
///
/// <para><b>What it replaces, and why the replacement is structural.</b> The response used to describe its own
/// omissions from TWO independent counters in two different units: core's listing budget (<c>limit=</c>, counted
/// while the sweep ran) and the render's own cut (<c>max_chars</c>, counted at a break point). Neither could see
/// the other, so neither could answer the question a caller actually has — how many of these findings can I see —
/// and on the live ARR order at plain defaults the two together said "3996 not listed" and "554 of the 1000
/// budget-listed appear above" while the answer was 554 of 4996. Every omission claim here is a SUBTRACTION against
/// the sweep's own totals, taken after emission stops, so there is one number and one source for it. The 2026-08-18
/// layer rule survives as this class's internal discipline: the causes are still named separately, but they are
/// decomposed out of one computation instead of raced by two.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The DECLARED SUBJECT set, and the boolean it replaces.</b> The first cut of this class carried one
/// <c>_listing</c> flag standing for two different lane facts — "did the dangling walk run" and "does this mode
/// build a per-plugin listing" — and a section count read unconditionally off <c>Reports</c>, which means different
/// things per lane. Six distinct wrong sentences came out of that in two review rounds, three of them created by
/// the folds for the other three: a <c>findings=["missing_masters"]</c> json response that reported no sections at
/// all, a <c>counts_only</c> response claiming "0 of 3 plugin section(s) were rendered" over a response that
/// dropped nothing, an opener inside the gate and its closer outside it. So the accounting is now CONSTRUCTED with
/// the subjects the lane actually has (<see cref="SweepSubject"/>), each carrying what the sweep FOUND and what the
/// render EMITTED. Every sentence, every json field, the remedy and the reserve derive from that set. A lane
/// without sections cannot claim about them, and a lane with them cannot fail to — by construction rather than by
/// each clause remembering its own gate.</para>
///
/// <para><b>How #361 dies here rather than being patched.</b> Two invariants, neither of them a code path that has
/// to remember to run:
/// <list type="number">
/// <item>Being missing is MEASURED AT THE TOTAL, never reported at an exit. There is no flag set where a loop
/// breaks, so there is no "the cut landed somewhere that never set the flag" — the silent last-section cut, in both
/// transports, is unrepresentable rather than fixed.</item>
/// <item>The accounting and the boundary footer are RESERVED out of the caller's <c>max_chars</c> before the body
/// renders, never appended past it. This is <see cref="ReadSentences.ClauseReserve"/>'s construction, which #342's
/// review arrived at over the same overshoot one tool over: a 2000-char batch returning ~3100, with the overrun
