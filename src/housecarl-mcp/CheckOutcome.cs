/// <summary>
/// WHAT THIS RESPONSE ACTUALLY DID — composed ONCE per response, read by every caller-facing sentence and every
/// json field on the merged <c>check</c> surface.
///
/// <para><b>Why it exists.</b> The merged response composes some forty caller-facing claims from state captured at
/// three different moments — selection time, sweep time, render time — across three families. Every claim used to
/// be composed at its own site from whatever happened to be in scope there, so each site could read the wrong
/// quantity, the wrong moment or the wrong family's units, and fixing one taught the next site nothing. Two review
/// rounds found the same class five times, and the folds for it generated it again: a scope sentence counting
/// refused seeds as validated ones, a response-level "ran every family" chosen off the SELECTION while one family's
/// whole section was a refusal, a duplicate key in one family object, a reserve that did not measure four fields
/// the render writes. AGENTS.md §5 #11's class rule fired, and the ruling (Aaron-go 2026-08-22) is this value: the
/// rule this branch already applies to individual sentences — one computation, two transports — raised one level.
/// </para>
///
/// <para><b>The discipline, which is what makes it worth its name.</b> Every quantity here is MEASURED, or read
/// from the artifact that did the work, in one hop. Nothing is re-derived at a call site and nothing is arithmetic
/// over two collections at the place that prints it — that spelling is exactly what produced
/// <c>Resolved.Count() + Unresolved.Count</c> under the word "validated".</para>
///
/// <para><b>SELECTION IS NOT OUTCOME.</b> <see cref="SweepFamilySelection"/> says what the caller asked for.
/// This says what came back. A family can be selected and refuse, and a response-level sentence composed off the
/// selection then claims an answer the response does not carry. Every response-level claim reads
/// <see cref="Ran"/> / <see cref="Refused"/> / <see cref="NotSelected"/> here, never <c>Selection.Ran</c> or
/// <c>Selection.NotRun</c>.</para>
///
/// <para><b>THE REMAINING-LITERAL INVENTORY — this list IS the completeness claim.</b> Every caller-facing claim in
/// a merged response reads this value, EXCEPT the ones below. The list exists so a reviewer can tell an INVENTORIED
/// literal from a FORGOTTEN one: an unlisted claim that does not read this value is a migration gap, and the way to
/// find one is to apply the membership test rather than to trust the list's length.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The membership test, stated so it can be applied rather than believed.</b> A claim may stay a literal
/// only where all three hold. It reads ONE field of the artifact that did the work — the family result
/// (<see cref="ErrorCheckResult"/>, <see cref="ScriptCheckResult"/>, <see cref="DialogueSeedResult"/>) or the
/// per-family accounting those results feed, both of which are 4a's, produced by the pass that measured them. It
/// does NO arithmetic at the site that prints it. And it composes across NO family and NO second moment. Fail any
/// one and the claim belongs on this value instead: <c>Resolved.Count() + Unresolved.Count</c> failed the second,
/// the response-level "ran every family" failed the third, and both are why this type exists.</para>
///
/// <para>What that leaves, each listed by name with the artifact it reads:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><b>The errors family's head and rows</b> (<c>ReadTools.AppendErrorsHead</c> / <c>AppendErrorsSection</c>,
/// <c>JsonWire.WriteErrorsHead</c> / <c>WriteErrorsSection</c>) — every count reads its own field of
/// <see cref="ErrorCheckResult"/>, the artifact the errors sweep produced.</item>
/// <item><b>The scripts family's head and rows</b> (<c>AppendScriptsHead</c> / <c>AppendScriptsSection</c>,
/// <c>WriteScriptsHead</c> / <c>WriteScriptsSection</c>) — the same, off <see cref="ScriptCheckResult"/>.</item>
/// <item><b>The dialogue family's seed heads, topic blocks and unreachable rows</b>
/// (<see cref="DialogueSweepRender"/>'s composers) — each renders ONE <see cref="DialogueSeedResult"/>'s own
/// report. The family's COUNTS are not here: they are <see cref="Dialogue"/>.</item>
/// <item><b>Each family's boundary</b> (<c>CheckAccounting.Boundary</c>) — a standing claim about what that family
/// can and cannot tell you. It is a constant per family, not a quantity.</item>
/// <item><b>The accounting's EMITTED counts</b> (<c>CheckAccounting</c>'s <c>_emitted</c> tallies) — registered by
/// <see cref="BoundedBody.Emit"/> where each unit LANDED. That is a measurement taken at the only moment it can be
/// taken, and moving it here would be re-deriving it.</item>
/// <item><b>The knob echoes</b> — <c>limit=</c> and <c>max_chars=</c>, printed back as the caller passed

/// <item><b><c>findings_defaulted</c></b> — a fact about the CALL, not about the outcome: whether
