/// <summary>
/// SELF-CONTAINED CI REGRESSION GUARD for the LOAD-ORDER INTEGRITY SWEEP (housecarl_check_errors — audit A1). Drives the
/// REAL product path (<see cref="ErrorCheck.Run"/> — what housecarl_check_errors calls through the thin service wrapper)
/// against a SYNTHESIZED 4-plugin order in TEMP — NO Skyrim.esm, so it runs in CI.
///
/// THE GAP (reproduced by construction): no general "validate every record" verb existed — validate_dialogue is
/// DIAL/QUST-only. The sweep walks every record's FormLinks and reports dangling refs, missing masters, and parse
/// failures, the data-layer twin of the CK's "Check For Errors".
///
/// FIXTURE — four plugins, two of them masters, one omitted from the loaded order ON PURPOSE:
///   • HcCeMaster.esm  — defines a Race (HcCeMasterRace). Present in the order.
///   • HcCeGhost.esm   — defines a Race (HcCeGhostRace). DECLARED by HcCeBad as a master, but NOT loaded → the
///                       missing-master fixture, and every ref into it is therefore also dangling.
///   • HcCeClean.esp   — masters [HcCeMaster]; one NPC whose Race → HcCeMasterRace (a VALID ref). The clean control:
///                       a Mutagen-written plugin whose masters all resolve must produce ZERO findings.
///   • HcCeBad.esp     — masters [HcCeMaster, HcCeGhost]; NPC1 Race → HcCeGhostRace (missing-master + dangling), NPC2
///                       Race → 0F0F0F:HcCeMaster.esm (dangling, master PRESENT — isolates "dangling" from "missing").
/// The order built for the resolver is [Master, Clean, Bad] — Ghost on disk but NOT in the order.
///
/// Arms (ALL required — a GREEN must mean "the contract holds"):
///   CLEAN-CONTROL   — HcCeClean.esp produces NO report (valid ref + a fresh NPC's default-null links are not flagged:
///                     the no-false-positive teeth, and the proof a null FormLink is treated as a legal optional).
///   DANGLING-GHOST  — HcCeBad's dangling set contains the ref to HcCeGhostRace (a ref into an absent master).
///   DANGLING-DEAD   — HcCeBad's dangling set contains the ref to 0F0F0F:HcCeMaster.esm (master present, target absent).
///   DANGLING-TOTAL  — exactly 2 dangling refs across the sweep (no stray links from the fresh NPCs).
///   SOURCE-ATTRIB   — each dangling ref names its SOURCE record (editorid + "Npc" type), not just the target.
///   MISSING-MASTER  — HcCeBad lists HcCeGhost.esm as a missing master; HcCeMaster.esm (present) is NOT listed.
///   MISSING-ISOLATE — no plugin reports HcCeMaster.esm missing (a present master is never a false missing-master).
///   SCANNED         — the whole-order sweep scanned 3 plugins (Master, Clean, Bad — Ghost is not in the order).
///   SCOPE           — scope=[HcCeBad.esp] reports only Bad (1 plugin scanned), Clean absent.
///   SCOPE-Q3        — scope=[a name not in the order] fails LOUD ("not in the load order"), no reports (never a silent skip).
///   CAP             — limit=1 over Bad's 2 dangling refs returns 1 but reports the TRUE total (2) and Capped.
///   OFF-ORDER-SELF   — an off-order file's link to a record IT DEFINES is not dangling (the patch-links-its-own-new-record case).
///   OFF-ORDER-DANGLE — its truly-dead refs DO dangle and its absent declared master IS a missing-master finding.
///   OFF-ORDER-STAMP  — the result stamps the off-order names (OffOrderScanned) and counts them in PluginsScanned;
///                      mixing an active scope name with an off-order file reports both (HCBR-2026-07-14-02 gap 3:
///                      the pre-enable verify sweep of a patch houseCARL just wrote).
///   PLAYERREF-WHITELIST — engine-implicit refs (000014 PlayerRef, 000007 Player, in Skyrim.esm) are NOT flagged dangling
///                     (HCBR checkerrors-playerref-dangling-false-positive: check_errors was reporting 531/531 false → 000014).
///   PLAYERREF-CONTROL   — a DIFFERENT sub-0x800 form (000015:Skyrim.esm) IS still flagged and the plugin totals 1 dangling:
///                     the exemption is a PRECISE 2-form set, not the whole reserved range, so a real typo'd low FormID surfaces.
///   OWNER-RANK          — a faction-owned container item's COED RequiredRank -1 (0xFFFFFFFF → id FFFFFF) is NOT a dangling ref
///                     (#207): when the owner faction lives in a master, a bare overlay mis-types the owner to UntypedOwner and
///                     exposes the rank word AS a FormLink; the sweep exempts that word (ErrorCheck.UntypedOwnerVariableData).
///   OWNER-DATA-CHECKED  — the owner FORM itself is still swept — a faction owner in an ABSENT master DOES dangle + is a missing
///                     master (the exemption drops ONLY the ambiguous rank word, never the owner reference).
///   OWNER-RANK-TOTAL    — exactly 1 dangling across the owner order (both chests' rank words exempt; only the broken owner form) —
///                     without the fix the same order totals 3 (two FFFFFF rank artifacts + the ghost owner).
///   NARROW-FORMIDS  — formids=[one dangling SOURCE] narrows the sweep AND its totals to that record (#282).
///   NARROW-EDITORID — editorid_contains= narrows case-insensitively to the other one.
///   NARROW-TYPE     — type=NPC_ keeps both findings, type=RACE keeps none (the scope rides the record STREAM).
///   NARROW-NOTE     — a narrowed result carries a FilterNote saying the counts are scope-relative; an unnarrowed one doesn't.
///   CLASS-MASTERS-ONLY — findings=[missing_masters] skips the link walk; the render says dangling "NOT CHECKED", NOT 0
///                     (a skipped check that reads as a clean one is the Q3 break this tool exists to catch).
///   CLASS-DANGLING-ONLY — findings=[dangling] skips the master read; the render says missing masters "NOT CHECKED".
///   CLASS-Q3        — an unrecognized findings= value fails LOUD, names the legal set, and says the unread class is unfilterable.
///   COUNTS-ONLY     — counts_only=true keeps the totals exact, builds NO per-plugin body, and tallies dangling refs by TARGET plugin.
///   COUNTS-ONLY-NOT-COMPUTED — a normal sweep leaves Histogram null: "not computed" ≠ "nothing found".
///   JSON-PARITY     — format=json PARSES, agrees with the text totals, and emits null (not 0) for an unchecked class.
///   COUNTS-ONLY-NO-WALK — findings=[missing_masters]+counts_only leaves Histogram NULL and says the walk was not run,
///                     rather than rendering an empty histogram as "nothing to tally" (PR #288 review, finding 2).
///   MASTER-COUNT-PLUGIN-LEVEL — under a record scope the note marks the missing-master count plugin-level and NOT
///                     narrowed; the plain claim returns when there is no plugin-level number to caveat (finding 3).
///   UNREAD-TRUNC-FLAG — a budget-cut counts_only json flags the shortened `unread` honesty list (finding 4).
///   COUNTS-ONLY-EXCLUDED-NAMED — counts_only text NAMES the unparseable plugins, not just the header count (finding 5).
///   CLAIM-ONLY-WHEN-SCOPED — findings= alone lists the filter WITHOUT the not-the-whole-plugin claim: that total IS the
///                     complete whole-order figure, so the claim would be false about the number it sits under. A record
///                     scope brings the claim back (PR #288 RE-review, finding 3).
///   BASELINE-REACHABLE — with limit= consumable by the base-game baseline, the MOD plugin still appears WITH its
///                     findings listed (#344 — the acceptance shape: before the fix it vanished from Reports entirely).
///   BASELINE-TOTALS-EXACT / -SECTIONS-LOAD-ORDER — the totals still count everything and Capped still fires; the base
///                     master is swept last for BUDGET but its section still renders in load-order position.
///   BASELINE-OMITTED-NAMED — the cap names WHICH plugin lost entries and how many, in the result and the render (Q3:
///                     a plugin that lost its whole set has no section to read the loss off).
///   BASELINE-SUMMARY / -NOT-IN-SCOPE — the split is stated and NAMES the plugins counted as baseline; a sweep that
///                     never looked at one says nothing about baseline ("clean" and "never checked" must not read alike).
///   BASELINE-PHASE-CLAUSE-ONLY-WHEN-IT-BIT / -AMPLE-BUDGET-UNCHANGED — the budget-order sentence appears only where the
///                     order decided something, and an ample budget lists every finding exactly as before.
///   SOURCE-HISTOGRAM / -NOT-COMPUTED — counts_only tallies by SOURCE plugin beside the TARGET axis; with the walk
///                     skipped BOTH are null and the render says so (an absent axis must not read as an empty one).
///   RENDER-CUT-COUNTS-ITS-OWN-OMISSION / -SILENT-WHEN-IT-DID-NOT-CUT / -JSON-DERIVABLE / -ENTRY-COUNT-IS-WHAT-IT-EMITTED
///                     — the max_chars cut is counted and stated by the RENDER, in the render's terms and the budget
///                     line's unit; the capped line's subjects are the budget's alone. Reach: the notice fires at a
///                     section BOUNDARY; a cut inside the last section is #361, pre-existing.
///   BASELINE-PHASE-CLAUSE-NOT-A-SUBTRACTION / -STILL-PRINTS-WITH-A-MOD-IN-SCOPE — the ordering sentence gates on a
///                     stated fact, on a fixture where the two counts a subtraction would use deliberately disagree.
///   BASELINE-RECORD-SCOPE-NOT-SWEPT / -STILL-SWEPT — "swept" means the scope admitted a record, not that the file was
///                     opened; a master filtered out of the scope must not report as covered-and-clean.
///   BASELINE-PHASE-CLAUSE-NEEDS-A-NON-BASE-PLUGIN — the ordering sentence needs both groups it compares.
///   COUNTS-ONLY-NOTE-NOT-REPEATED — the mode note rides the first axis only.
///   OMITTED-NULL-UNDER-COUNTS-ONLY — counts_only lists nothing by design, so it reports no omissions rather than
///                     reporting the entire sweep as dropped.
///   BASE-SET-BY-CONSTRUCTION — the baseline set IS Mutagen's Implicits.BaseMasters, never a list kept here (#344).
///   BASELINE-JSON-PARITY — the json carries the same split, names the base set, flags whether one was in scope, and
///                     carries both new tables; an unchecked class emits null, not 0.
///
/// OWNER FIXTURE (#207, its own order): HcCeMaster.esm also defines a Faction; HcCeOwner.esp masters [HcCeMaster, HcCeGhost]
///   and carries two owned containers — one owned by the PRESENT master's faction (rank -1 → must not dangle) and one owned by a
///   faction id in the ABSENT ghost master (rank -1 → the owner form dangles, the rank word does not). Built as [Master, Owner].
///
/// PLAYERREF FIXTURE (its own order, engine-implicit whitelist): a stub Skyrim.esm base master, on disk but NOT loaded
///   (the absent-master shape again, so every ref into it fails ResolveWinner), and HcCePlayer.esp mastering [Skyrim] with
///   three NPCs whose Race points at 000014 (PlayerRef, whitelisted), 000007 (Player, whitelisted), and 000015 (a
///   non-whitelisted sub-0x800 control). Built as [HcCePlayer] alone — Skyrim.esm is the missing master.
///
/// COVERAGE NOTE (Q3 — name what this guard LEANS ON rather than re-proves): PARSE failures are not synthesized here.
///   Whole-plugin exclusion rides on the index build's ExcludedPlugins machinery (exercised across the suite), and the
///   per-record link-walk fault isolation is the SAME try/catch idiom proven by effect-chain-guard + the cross_plugin_query
///   scan. The sweep surfaces both verbatim (ExcludedPlugins + the unscannable accounting), it does not re-implement them.
///
/// THE ASSERTION RULE (pinned here after this guard shipped a tautology through two review rounds): AN INVARIANT
///   ARM ASSERTS AGAINST A FIXTURE-KNOWN EXPECTED VALUE — NEVER AGAINST A PHRASE THE RENDER ITSELF EMITS. The cap
///   invariant excused every overrun that contained "raise it to at least"; the render appends that notice to every
///   response longer than its cap, so the arm could not fail and the two folds it was meant to pin were pinned by
///   nothing. A number the fixture knows (a length, a count, a total the sweep computed) can be wrong and be caught;
///   a substring the response composed about itself agrees with the response by construction. Where an arm must read
///   the render's own words — following a remedy to the number it names, say — the words locate the value and the
///   ASSERTION is still made against something measured independently.
