///
/// <para><b>Why it exists.</b> Review round 2 (2026-08-22) found six separate conditionals with no arm that could
/// fail, and AGENTS.md §5 #11's class rule fired on them together: the arms were being written one per FINDING,
/// never from an inventory of the shapes the surface produces, so whole shapes had no fixture at all. The headline
/// instance was that no merged <c>counts_only</c> render at a biting cap existed anywhere in <c>check-guard</c> —
/// which is precisely the shape #394 is about, so <c>HistogramByTarget</c>, <c>HistogramBySource</c>,
/// <c>HistogramByProperty</c>, <c>UnreadRows</c> and <c>ScriptScanRows</c> were never allocated, never charged and
/// never asked for monotonicity, no-stranding or exactness. Eleven more arms would have made the suite bigger
/// without making the shape coverage complete. This is the fixture instead: build the shapes once, drive the
/// properties over all of them.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The inventory.</b> Every subset of the three families, each in the LISTING and the <c>counts_only</c>
/// lane, plus the states a family can be in that are not "ran": REFUSED (its own section is a refusal) and
/// OFF-ORDER (a named plugin the scripts family has no lane for). Crossed with the excluded-plugin ROSTER, which is
/// a response-level subject competing with every family in the response. Both transports and the cap band are swept
/// INSIDE each property rather than being rows of the inventory — a property that holds in one transport and not
/// the other is the drift the response layer's one-source rule exists to catch.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The fixture is TRIMMED on purpose.</b> Each shape's whole response is a few thousand characters, so
/// every property below can be asked at EVERY INTEGER CAP from 1 to above the whole response rather than at a
/// sample. What these arms are about is shape coverage, not scale; <c>check-measure</c> owns scale, on the live
/// order.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Its known-RED canary.</b> <c>MATRIX-INSIDE-ITS-CAP</c> reproduces A1 — a merged response with a large
