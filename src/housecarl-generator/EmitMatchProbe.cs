/// <c>.agents/skills/mutagen-reference/references/*.jsonl</c> is a generated artifact that is also checked in:
/// it ships in the plugin and it is what a dev-mode skill — and a reviewer checking a classification claim —
/// actually reads. Every other corpus guard regenerates into a temp dir and asserts against THAT, so a change to
/// the classifier or the emitter that lands without a regeneration leaves the shipped reference stale with CI
/// fully green. That is #335's defect class (a reference that disagrees with what the code models) reached by
/// omission rather than by a bug, and nothing was checking for it.
///
/// This closes it by comparison, not by reasoning: regenerate into a temp dir, compare byte-for-byte against the
/// committed tree, and name the file — and the line — that differs. The remedy is always the same, so the
/// failure says it outright rather than leaving the reader to infer it.
///
/// WHY A BYTE COMPARE IS SOUND HERE. The emit is deterministic (the catalog is a SortedDictionary over an
/// ordinal key and fields sort ordinal by name), and the shards are pinned <c>eol=lf</c> in .gitattributes, so
/// they are LF on disk on every platform and no autocrlf pass can move them. Measured before this guard was
/// written: two consecutive fresh emits in separate processes are byte-identical, in both the refs and the
/// generated tree. If a future change ever makes the emit order-dependent, this guard flapping is the correct
/// and loud symptom of that — it is not a reason to sort the comparison into agreement.
