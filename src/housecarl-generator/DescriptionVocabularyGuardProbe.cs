/// REGRESSION GUARD (standing CI instrument, self-contained) — CALLER-FACING PROSE VOCABULARY (#386).
///
/// <para><b>The gap this closes.</b> Nothing read the WORDS of two caller-facing prose surfaces: the
/// <c>[Description]</c> attributes a model reads to decide how to call a tool, and the consent prompts a modder
/// reads to decide whether to say yes. <c>write-surface-guard</c> and the <see cref="MustStateAttribute"/> /
/// <see cref="NoClaimsAttribute"/> walk both police the <see cref="WriteSentences"/> / <see cref="ReadSentences"/>
/// consts and reach neither; <c>wire-names-guard</c> does reach a <c>[Description]</c>, but only to parse the
/// brace shape declaration out of it and hold that against the reflected wire names — it has no opinion about the
/// sentence the declaration sits in, and a stale consent claim is invisible to it. So the in-place consent fix (#378) — which changed exactly one fact, that a REFUSED
/// call records nothing — left stale text behind that took FOUR sweeps to clear: three, run surface by surface,
/// found 11 on the <c>acknowledge=</c> parameters, 6 in the <c>WriteTools</c> lane parentheticals and 2 in the
/// handshake builders, and a fourth, run repo-wide by VOCABULARY instead, found fourteen more in homes the first
/// three had no reason to look at. (The per-pass counts are #386's own table; its headline totals those three
/// passes as thirteen, which is a discrepancy in the issue rather than something to average here — the counts
/// are given per pass so nothing restates a total its own itemisation contradicts.) Three of the four were triggered by a reviewer noticing a claim by eye rather than by
/// anything going red.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Two readers, because a completeness claim cannot certify itself.</b> This is the third design. The
/// first enumerated the surface by REFLECTION and was class-stopped: five measured routes carried a consent
/// sentence to a caller that reflection could not reach, including <c>compact_plugin</c>'s inline consent prompt.
/// The second scanned SOURCE LITERALS with a hand lexer and was class-stopped on the same class one design later:
/// the lexer could not see a literal inside an interpolation hole, so 201 shipped lines were outside the net, and
/// the arm chartered to make that falsifiable (compiled values covered by the scan) structurally could not see it
/// either — C# requires a compiled constant, and runtime-interpolated prose has none. Both deaths were the same
/// shape: <b>a completeness claim certified by an oracle derived from the machinery it certifies.</b></para>
///
/// <para>So the net is still the shipped source literals — that premise was never falsified, and every one of the
/// five routes IS a source literal — but the reading of them is done TWICE, by two independently written readers,
/// and the two are held against each other:
/// <list type="bullet">
///   <item><see cref="RoslynLiteralReader"/> (READER A) — the C# compiler's own parser. What counts as a literal
///         is its decision, not an opinion, so this reader cannot disagree with the build.</item>
///   <item><see cref="HandLiteralLexer"/> (READER B) — a second spelling written from C#'s lexical grammar,
///         sharing no code with A beyond the <see cref="SourceLiteral"/> record.</item>
/// </list>
/// <c>INV6-AGREE</c> asserts the two produce the same literals, file by file. A reader that stops early,
/// mis-decodes an escape, or cannot see into a hole makes them disagree and turns that arm red with the file
/// named. Neither reader is its own oracle, which is the property both prior designs lacked.</para>
///
/// <para><b>And the files those readers are handed come from the COMPILER'S RECEIPT, not from a directory
/// walk.</b> Two readers agreeing about a file set nobody certified is the same shape one floor up, and it was
/// measured: a <c>&lt;Compile Include&gt;</c>-linked source file shipped a false consent claim at 59/59 green.
/// So <c>MANIFEST-SET</c> holds the scanned file set against the portable-PDB document table of each shipped
/// assembly — the compiler's own record of what went into the thing that ships — in both directions. See
/// <see cref="ReadManifest"/> for the ruling that chose it (§4, Aaron-go 2026-08-26), the alternatives declined,
/// and the evaluation run before it was built. Above that receipt there is no further enumeration to certify:
/// what remains — that the guard runs, what is on the watchlist, and whether a sentence of known words is TRUE —
/// is declared residue, printed on every run in <see cref="NotInReach"/>.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The enumerations, and the question each answers.</b>
/// <list type="bullet">
///   <item><b>SOURCE</b> — every string-literal SENTENCE in the three shipped trees (<c>housecarl-mcp</c>,
///         <c>housecarl-core</c>, <c>housecarl-setup</c>), a sentence being a maximal run of adjacent literals
///         joined by <c>+</c> OR a run of consecutive <c>Append</c> / <c>Write</c> calls on one receiver,
///         optionally finished by the <c>Line</c> form of that verb: the unit an author writes. This answers
///         ABSENCE (INV1) — a phrase absent from every literal is absent from every string built out of them by
///         those two shapes. Assembly across control flow or through a helper is a DECLARED
///         boundary, printed on every run (<see cref="NotInReach"/>), not a claim this quietly covers.</item>
///   <item><b>SURFACE</b> — the compiled <c>[Description]</c> attributes of the tool assembly. This answers
///         PRESENCE and COMPLETENESS (INV3/INV4): "which verbs does a caller read" needs the text assembled, and
///         only the attribute knows which literals reached a description.</item>
/// </list></para>
///
///   INV1 — every consent-vocabulary phrase declared here is ABSENT from every shipped source literal, or the
///          sentence carrying it also states the clause that makes it true (the phrase's COMPANION).
///   INV2 — every declared exemption still matches a real site (materialises with the first declared row), and
///          the exemption table cannot degenerate into an allowlist of the surface (INV2-DEGEN, always runs).
///   INV3 — every write-verb RECITAL on the <c>[Description]</c> surface names only real verbs, and between them
///          the recitals name the whole published vocabulary.
///   INV4 — the two homes for the verb vocabulary still say the same thing and still say what this guard writes
///          down independently; the verb marked <c>(default)</c> is one verb, the same one at every site that
///          marks it, and the one the annotated slots actually default to; and the TAIL of the recital is the verb
///          the gloss glued to that tail describes.
///   INV5 — every compile-time constant on the surface (the <c>[Description]</c> arguments and the <c>const</c>
///          strings) is covered by the SOURCE scan. A third kind of evidence, through the compiler and the
///          runtime rather than through either reader.
///   INV6 — every scanned file PARSES, and the two readers AGREE about what is in it. This is the arm the
///          by-construction claim rests on.
///
/// <para><b>The pin.</b> <see cref="Phrases"/>, <see cref="PublishedVocabulary"/>, <see cref="PublishedDefault"/>
/// and <see cref="TailGlossVerb"/> are INDEPENDENTLY WRITTEN literals, never derived from the consts they check. A
/// const-concat conversion verified against the same const that produced it is the check-A tautology — it stays
/// green when the const is emptied. <c>remedy-verbs-guard</c>'s SITE-UNKNOWN-VERB arm documents the same pattern
/// for the same reason. A deliberate change to the published vocabulary turns INV4 red once, on purpose. A silent
/// one turns it red too.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Declared boundary — what this does NOT reach, and why.</b> The by-construction claim is exactly as
/// honest as this list, so the run PRINTS it (see <see cref="NotInReach"/>) rather than leaving it in a docstring
/// that no CI log carries.
/// <list type="bullet">
///   <item><b>Comments, including XML docstrings.</b> Not literals; skipped by both readers, deliberately.
///         Authored narrative prose is the non-mechanizable residue #337/#330 ruled on, and the docstrings on
///         these very builders are part of it. So are the READMEs, the shipped skills, the CHANGELOG, and the

///   <item><b>Text assembled around a value</b> — <c>"shown " + name + "once"</c>, or a phrase split across an
///         interpolation hole. The <c>+</c>-run merge is conservative (it joins literals separated by nothing but
///         <c>+</c>) and a hole is rendered as <see cref="SourceLiteral.HoleMarker"/>, which carries no letters.
///         So a phrase split around a value carries no phrase in any fragment. This cannot be closed short of
///         dataflow analysis and is not claimed to be: what the guard makes structural is that putting a consent
///         claim in front of a caller AS ORDINARY TEXT takes a deliberate act. Splitting a sentence around a value
///         to get past a vocabulary guard IS that act, and it leaves the evidence of intent in the diff — which is
///         the standard #386 asks for, not a proof of impossibility.</item>
///   <item><b>Non-source text.</b> Third-party library messages surfaced to a caller, and the shipped JSON data
