/// REFUSAL-COMPLETENESS GUARD (#403) — the read surface's refusal grammar is complete, and STAYS complete.
///
/// <para><b>Why it exists.</b> The refusal grammar shipped as 81 explicit <c>Wire.Refuse</c> call sites, and the
/// set of sites needing one was found by running a regex over two hand-named files. Round 1 of the pre-PR review
/// found that population short by fourteen — twelve refusals produced inside a helper and returned verbatim, a
/// ternary whose two arms were both bare (the regex wants <c>return "error:</c> on ONE line; that line reads
/// <c>return comparisonForm</c>), and a whole json-capable read tool that was never in the file set. Reviewer 3
/// then proved by mutation that reverting ALL fourteen <c>ReadTools</c> call sites to prose left the entire
/// 131-probe suite green. So the grammar had neither completeness by construction nor a guard that noticed its
/// absence — AGENTS.md §3's hand-wired-coverage failure mode, restated on the response layer.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Two binding properties, both load-bearing.</b></para>
/// <list type="number">
///   <item><b>It PARSES.</b> Roslyn walks return statements; there is no regex anywhere in the enumeration. The
///   thing that defeated the sweep was a construct spanning lines, which is precisely what a line-oriented
///   pattern cannot see and what a syntax tree sees for free. <see cref="PreFixTernaryFixture"/> preserves that
///   exact pre-fix ternary as a permanent known-RED fixture: <c>INV-FIXTURE-RED</c> asserts the enumerator flags
///   it. <b>If that fixture ever passes, the guard is broken, not the tree</b> — a checker whose known-red case
///   comes back green is a broken checker, never a clean surface (§11).</item>
///   <item><b>The population is DERIVED, never listed.</b> <see cref="DerivePopulation"/> takes every scope in
///   which the transport is DECIDED — a <c>Guard.Tool</c> body consulting <c>Wire.WantsJson</c> /
///   <c>Wire.CrossQueryFormat</c> — or HANDED over — a method or local function declaring a <c>bool json</c> or
///   a <c>QueryFormat</c> parameter. A new json-capable read tool enrols itself, and so does a new helper given
///   the transport; a hand-named file set is what let <c>housecarl_check</c> sit outside the trace with a bare
///   refusal and its own comment stating the rule it was breaking, and the tool-body-only draft of this net is
///   what let <c>RenderListAggregate</c> revert to prose while the guard stayed green.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// <para><b>The allowlist is small BECAUSE the population is derived.</b> Of the refusal returns that stay bare
/// on the tree, only the ones in a policed scope are the guard's business, and a text-lane return inside one is
/// excluded STRUCTURALLY rather than by hand when the json arm returned above it (<see cref="TransportAlreadyLeft"/>).
