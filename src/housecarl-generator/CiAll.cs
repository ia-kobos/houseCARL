/// The CI "run-all" probe runner (CI optimization Phase 2B; plan dev/plans/CI_OPTIMIZATION_RESEARCH_2026-06-24.md).
/// Runs the CI regression guards IN ONE PROCESS (all but one — the timing-fragile freshness-capture-guard stays
/// a cold step; see its registry note below), so the big Mutagen assembly loads + JITs once (vs once per
/// `dotnet run`/exe step) and the schema corpus is reflected once (CorpusGenerator memoizes — Phase 2A) instead of
/// ~21x. Replaces the per-probe steps in ci.yml with a single invocation.
///
/// Failure model — STRICTLY BETTER than the per-step job: every probe runs even if an earlier one fails, so one
/// run surfaces EVERY failing probe (the per-step job stopped at the first red step). The job still goes red if
/// any probe fails. Each failure is emitted as a GitHub `::error::` annotation naming the probe.
///
/// SAFETY — the per-probe co-hosting harness (research §5; the only cross-probe shared state in the suite):
///   * CorpusRulebook.CorpusPath (the one mutable static) is reset to the runner's canonical corpus BEFORE each
///     probe, so the 7 "check-first" probes (vmad-poly, poly-field-descend, sameshape, nullarm, formlink-null,
///     gendered-nav, floi-fields) reuse it and never validate against a prior probe's deleted temp corpus.
///   * setup-update-lock-guard nulls the CODEX_HOME env var and never restores it — snapshot + restore around
///     every probe.
///   * Each probe runs inside its own try/catch: a probe that THROWS (rather than returning non-zero) fails only
///     itself. (Many probes wrap their body only in try/finally cleanup, not try/catch-return.)
/// Everything else is already per-probe-scoped: Guid-unique temp dirs (deleted in each probe's finally) and
/// explicit-path UserConfigStores. The class-parents/decompile caches are per-LoadOrderService-INSTANCE (each
/// probe builds its own), not process statics, so co-hosting is safe (research §5 #6).
