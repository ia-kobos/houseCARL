/// REGRESSION GUARD (standing CI instrument, self-contained) — CODEX UMBRELLA COVERAGE.
///
/// The Codex packaging ships one umbrella routing skill (.agents/skills/housecarl/SKILL.md) that hand-lists
/// houseCARL's MCP tools and helper skills. The umbrella is hand-maintained, so nothing otherwise forces it
/// to track the tool/skill surface: it
/// silently drifted from full coverage to 9 of ~45 tools over ~2 months because adding a tool never touched it.
///
/// This guard makes that drift impossible by construction. It reflects the REAL [McpServerTool] names off the
/// housecarl-mcp assembly — the authoritative registered set, not a source-text pattern a brittle grep can miss —
/// and reads the real .agents/skills/* folders, then asserts every helper is referenced in the umbrella — or allow-listed as
/// a deliberate omission. A session that adds housecarl_foo or a new skill and forgets the Codex router now gets
/// a RED CI arm naming exactly what to add. Same "green only if the checker has teeth" shape as the other guards:
/// RED arms feed a synthetic omission and assert it fires; the allow-list is proven to actually suppress.
///
///   INV1 — every current MCP tool name is referenced in the umbrella (or allow-listed).
///   INV2 — every bundled skill slug is referenced in the umbrella (or allow-listed).
